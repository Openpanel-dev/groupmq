title: What is GroupMQ?
description: A per-group FIFO queue for Node.js + Redis with BullMQ-like ergonomics.
---

GroupMQ is a fast, lightweight job queue for Node.js backed by Redis that guarantees per-group FIFO processing. Any worker can process any `groupId`, but only one job per group runs at a time.

### Why use it?

- Per-group FIFO ordering without global bottlenecks
- Minimal, BullMQ-inspired API
- Scales horizontally across workers
- Built-in retries, delays, and repeating jobs (cron)
- Designed for performance and low Redis load

### Core ideas

- A Queue stores jobs partitioned by `groupId`
- Workers reserve jobs while ensuring at-most-one active job per group
- Ordering is preserved using `orderMs` and optional `orderingDelayMs`
