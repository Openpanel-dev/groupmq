Because GroupMQ is focused on excellent group handling, we don’t plan to add many features beyond that core. Below is our roadmap of improvements and additions. If you have a feature request, feel free to open an issue or submit a PR on GitHub.

1. Update job data
2. Customize how many jobs per group can be active (now its just 1)
3. BullBoard integration improvements
4. A modern UI for GroupMQ
